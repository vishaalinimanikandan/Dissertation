Generated: 2025-07-28 11:08:20

SUMMARY:
- 52 charts not perturbed (out of 200)
- 952 perturbations excluded from evaluation (out of 1,650)
- Total: 1,004 documented exclusions with evidence

KEY FINDINGS:
1. These are REAL technical failures, not arbitrary exclusions
2. Each failure has specific evidence from the data
3. Common issues: API errors, empty data, low confidence, extreme perturbations
4. This demonstrates GPT-4V's actual limitations on difficult images
